## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to investigate customer churn in the telecommunications industry by analyzing a dataset containing information about customer demographics, subscribed services, contract details, churn status, and more. The goal is to understand the factors influencing churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.

## Methodology
The project follows the steps outlined in the "METHODOLOGY" section of the report, which include:

1. **Data Sourcing**: Obtaining and preprocessing the dataset containing customer information.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Performing statistical tests to assess the significance of relationships between features and churn.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Engineering new features or transformations based on domain knowledge and insights from EDA.
5. **Model Development**: Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and training multiple models.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using various evaluation metrics.
7. **Interpretation and Insights**: Interpreting the results of the predictive models to understand the factors driving customer churn.
8. **Model Deployment and Monitoring**: (Optional) Deploying the final predictive model into production systems and implementing monitoring mechanisms.
